# CSharp-ValidatingFormSubmission

Let's get some more practice. In this assignment, you'll build a basic app that just runs validations on a variety of form fields. Use Data Annotations and Models to generate your error messages. Errors should be rendered for each field that submits invalid data.


 Create a User model with the properties as shown
 Add validations to the model
 Create a form that accepts the displayed fields
 If there are errors, render the form page and display errors
 If there are no errors, redirect to a success page
